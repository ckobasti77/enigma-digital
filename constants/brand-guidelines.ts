  {
    title: 'Core Narrative',
    body: `Enigma Digital exists to help ambitious teams turn complex growth goals into measurable product wins. Our language should signal partnership, momentum, and accountability—less agency fluff, more engineered outcomes.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Voice & Tone',
    body: `Speak with confident warmth. We combine senior product expertise with an embedded, “in the trenches” mindset. Keep sentences sharp, avoid jargon where plain language works, and back claims with results whenever possible.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Logo & Lockup',
    body: `Use the supplied primary logomark on light or neutral backgrounds. Minimum clear space equals the height of the “E” in Enigma. For dark surfaces, deploy the reversed version. Never stretch, rotate, or recolor the mark.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Color System',
    body: `Lean on the core palette already defined in Tailwind (cyan accents, deep slate backgrounds, white surfaces). Accent tones are strategic, not decorative—use them to highlight interaction, metrics, or proof points.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Typography',
    body: `Headlines use the custom Aeonik stack (uppercase tracking optional). Supporting copy stays in Aeonik regular/light with generous leading. Limit Deltha or Broken Console treatments to hero moments and motion content.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Imagery & Motion',
    body: `Visuals should reinforce momentum—gradient glows, product mockups, 3D laptop rigs, or case-study artefacts. Motion is purposeful: hover lifts, timeline reveals, and subtle parallax that underline conversion moments.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Case Study Structure',
    body: `Always frame outcomes first, then walk through challenge → approach → measurable impact. Include metrics, timelines, and tools to show rigor. Keep artifacts anonymized unless approvals are on file.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Social & Content',
    body: `Lead with product impact and “build smarter” narratives. Use a question or stat up top, drop a key takeaway, then invite readers to dive deeper or start a conversation. CTA language mirrors the site: “Start a project”, “See how we deliver”.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Voice Consistency Checklist',
    body: `Before publishing, ask: Does it showcase measurable progress? Does it sound like a senior partner, not a vendor? Is there a clear next step? Trim anything that feels like filler or overdrive hype.`,
  },
